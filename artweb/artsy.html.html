	<h1>Willow's Writing Center</h1>
	<p>I started writing fiction in middle school, where I wrote short stories and poems. In high school, I found a proper place to practice through the creative writing club I established with my friends and teacher. Now, I've set up a blog where I post my short stories every week.</p>
	<h2>Sample:</h2>
	<h3>“What,” she gasps, “the hell is happening to me?”</h3>
	<h4>Her voice stings in her throat; the potions she’s been forced to drink, the burning incantations she’s recited, render her all but speechless. Singed runes summon burns on her skin, real and ghost pains alike aching with each move. She pulls on her chains when she speaks nonetheless, fighting against them as much as she can. But nothing bothers her captor. He simply stares down at her, his silence her answer for a moment.</h4>
	<h5>“We’re making progress,” he finally says. “The Priests’ experiments seem to be paying off.”</h5>
	<h6>“Did my screams tell you that?” Mockery drips from her voice. Progress. For them, of course that means having her suffer. Hurting a witch is the Sect’s favorite pastime, with watching them writhe adding to the flavor. But this isn’t just for passing time. If they wanted to entertain themselves, they would have tried breaking her. Start with her hands, or her legs, maybe even remove them completely. But they’ve left her whole. Battered still, but whole. Well enough to serve this sick trick they’ve cooked up now.</h6>
