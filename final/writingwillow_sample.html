	<p>Do not seek the elder spirits.

Their promises are sweet, passions running strong. They nestle deep within the woods, demanding the farthest treks for their attention. Invisible to the naked eye, they beckon from dead roots and dried bones. Formless vagabonds until a deal is struck. They patiently await the lonely, the angry, the weak, the desperate. They give their infinite kindness, in exchange for a finite vessel. They make homes out of their bargainers, ceaselessly clinging and endlessly caring to and for his every need. Every ailment cured, every misfortune reversed, every mistake corrected. They are eternal guardians, and powerful leeches. They cower behind thickets and bundles of flesh; bare their gifts and hide their malice, every seeker wasting away the second he is embraced. They ease the mind of their host until nothing is left of it. Loving, comforting him into a gentle sleep. They hide, they feed long after he is gone. Until his body grows feeble. Until his bones return to the earth.

Do not seek the elder spirits.</p>

	<p>“What is this… dear God, what did you do?”

           The Boss lies—hangs, rather—on the wall, bloodied, beaten, and motionless. Almost crucified, the way nails bind her wrists, like a painting strung in a gallery. But her arms are pinned high above her head, her hands stuck together. Gashes line her face, her chest, her clothes, all caked in blood. Amelia sees the pins against her legs as she approaches, nearly gagging at the sight of flayed skin. This… this can’t be real. This can’t her doing. Whatever she’s done in her past could never match up to something like this. She needs to find her. Find her, and talk, and—
	       “You shouldn’t be in a place like this, hero.” She whips around at the sound of her voice, eyes instantly searching for answers to her thousands of questions. On the other side of the room, the girl only watches, waiting. “Vaga…” Her name comes slowly, softly, as does Amelia’s approach. “What happened here?” Vaga doesn’t move, her hands behind her back. As if she’s in service. As if this is some sort of job. “I freed myself,” she says</p>

	<p>“Who hurt you?”

The villain pauses, they’re eyes leveled at the ground, at their weapons that feel so much heavier now. Their answer comes in ragged breaths, in stillness and a bitten tongue. Don’t speak, instinct screams at them. Get up and fight. But they can’t move. Helpless and on their knees, they’re paralyzed under the hero’s question, under a burning gaze that they can’t see but feel instead. The sting somehow hurts worse than any fight they’ve ever had.

“Answer me. Who did this to you?” Silence hangs between them. What can they say? Words are so often their best weapon, and now? It’s a sword held against their neck, a gun aimed at their skull. Ready and waiting for them to pull the trigger. A clever tongue won’t pull them out of this, only ignorance and force will.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.“</p>
